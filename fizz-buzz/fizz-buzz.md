Write a program that uses `console.log` to print all the numbers from 1 to 100,
with two exceptions.
For numbers:
 * divisible by 3: print `"Fizz"` instead of the number
 * divisible by 5: print `"Buzz"` instead

Addon:
* Modify the program to print `"FizzBuzz"` for numbers that are divisible by 3 & 5 while still doing the above functionality.
